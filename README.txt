In the show seams part we needed to show the chosen seams - here's a short explanation about how we implemented that - 
first we needed to run the reduce/increase functions to create the "seamMapping" matrix which is the index matrix that indicated which indexed we removed. 
then we "fill" those indexes - whichever seam we removed we replace with "-1" and ten we print these pixel with the red color.
